# collatz
My dream has been to be able to be able to create visual aids for my studies on unsolved problems in mathematics. This code structures the collatz conjecture in a way that makes it very easy to see a very predictable pattern in the formation of sequences of numbers. In particular, it shows that only numbers 5 mod 8 have unpredictable sequence results, while all other numbers are guaranteed to follow a very regular pattern. The accomplishment of this code is that this is incredibly hard to see without a visual aid. By combining my knowledge to code with my knowledge of the collatz conjecture, I was am to make a reproducable design that shows this effect for thousands of digits while previous attempts had to be made by hand.
